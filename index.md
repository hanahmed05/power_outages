# Introduction

This report explores the **Power Outages Dataset**, which consists of **1,536 rows** and **57 features**, providing a comprehensive view of power outages across the United States. Compiled by Sayanti Mukherjee, Roshanak Nateghi, and Makaran Hastak, this dataset is a valuable resource for understanding the interplay between socioeconomic factors and the resilience of the U.S. electrical grid.

The motivation for analyzing this dataset stems from the growing importance of addressing how climate change and economic disparities affect power infrastructure. By examining this data, we aim to uncover trends and relationships that can inform utility companies, policymakers, and stakeholders about equitable energy distribution and the effects of demographic and economic factors on electricity usage.

## Investigative Question

This report is guided by the following research question:

**How do a state's total gross state product and its population proportion in urban clusters affect the total residential electricity sales?**

This question seeks to shed light on how socioeconomic and geographical factors influence electricity consumption, helping utility companies prioritize investments and improve energy accessibility.

## Key Features and Their Relevance

To address the research question, the analysis will focus on the following columns from the dataset:

1. **`TOTAL.REALGSP`**  
   Represents the inflation-adjusted gross state product (GSP) of a state, encompassing contributions from all industries and sectors. This metric is a key indicator of the economic strength of a state, measured in constant 2009 U.S. dollars.

2. **`POPPCT_UC`**  
   Denotes the percentage of a state's population residing in urban clustersâ€”defined as areas with populations between 2,500 and 50,000. Urban clusters capture demographic shifts and the economic significance of smaller towns and communities.

3. **`RES.SALES`**  
   Measures the total electricity consumption in the residential sector of a state, recorded in megawatt-hours. This serves as a proxy for household energy demand and is influenced by economic and demographic factors.

## Significance of the Analysis

This analysis is critical for understanding how socioeconomic and geographical variables drive electricity consumption patterns across the United States. By answering the investigative question, the findings can:

- Assist utility companies in identifying states with underserved populations.
- Inform policymakers on how to address disparities in energy access.
- Highlight how demographic and economic trends influence energy demand, particularly in light of climate change and evolving urbanization patterns.

By integrating these insights, this report aims to provide actionable recommendations for improving the resilience and equity of the energy sector.
